    <h1>Dance</h1>
    <h2>Definition:-</h2>
    <p>Dance is an art form and sport consisting of body movements with aesthetic and symbolic value, which can be improvised or choreographed.</p>
    <h2>Categorization:-</h2>
    <p>It can be categorized by choreography, repertoire of movements, historical period, or place of origin.</p>
    <h2>Performance:-</h2>
    <p>Typically performed with musical accompaniment, and sometimes involves the dancer playing a musical instrument.</p>
    <p>Dance is a performing art form that involves sequences of body movements with aesthetic and often symbolic value, either improvised or purposefully selected. It is a powerful impulse that can be channeled by skillful performers into something intensely expressive</p>
    <p>Dance can serve various purposes, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expressing emotions, moods, or ideas</li>
      <li>Telling a story</li>
      <li>Serving religious, political, economic, or social needs</li>
      <li>Releasing energy or taking delight in the movement itself</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every culture has different dance forms associated with it, and dance has evolved even before the arrival of written language. Archaeological findings suggest that dance is at least 9,000 years old in India.</p>
    <p>Dance is typically performed with musical accompaniment, and the choreography and music are meant to complement each other. Rhythm and dance are deeply linked, with dances generally having a characteristic tempo and rhythmic pattern.</p>
    <p>While dance can be a powerful impulse, it is also an art that can be practiced by a professional few. Dance competitions are organized events where contestants perform dances before judges for awards and prizes</p>
    <p>Ultimately, dance is a beautiful and meaningful art form that can stand alone or partner successfully with other arts like costume, scenery, poetry, drama, and music. One's personal dance aesthetic is shaped by factors like family, media, personal response, and kinesthetic response.</p>
